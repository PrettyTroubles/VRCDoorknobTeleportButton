# VRCDoorknobTeleportButton
Click on the Doorknob and it will take you to the room!

**How to set it up:**
Place a doorknob or door object in your scene that the player will click.

Attach this script to that object and ensure it has a collider with “Is Trigger” unchecked.

Create an empty GameObject at the destination inside the room and assign it to the teleportTarget field.

Test it out in VRChat—touch the knob, and voilà, instant room-hop!
